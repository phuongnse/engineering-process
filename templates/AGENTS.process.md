## Engineering process

Use the portable skills pinned by `.process/process.lock` for every non-trivial
change. Enter through `run-change` and use `processctl change ...` for specification,
planning, implementation registration, checkpoint verification, independent review,
finding resolution, and completion.

The project owns product decisions, domain contracts, exact verification commands,
and publication authority. The process distribution owns lifecycle semantics and
managed skills. Do not edit managed skills in this repository; update the pinned
distribution and synchronize them instead.

Independent review requires an attested read-only actor and context that did not
implement the current cycle. No particular agent host is required. Missing or stale
evidence, self-review, and publication without separate authorization are blocking.
